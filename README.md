In this machine learning project, we will recognize handwritten characters, i.e, English alphabets from A-Z. This we are going to achieve by modeling a neural network that will have to be trained over a dataset containing images of alphabets.

Project Prerequisites
Below are the prerequisites for this project:

Python (3.7.4 used)
IDE (Jupyter used)

Required frameworks are-

Numpy (version 1.16.5)
cv2 (openCV) (version 3.4.2)
Keras (version 2.3.1)
Tensorflow (Keras uses TensorFlow in backend and for some image preprocessing) (version 2.0.0)
Matplotlib (version 3.1.1)
Pandas (version 0.25.1)

Dataset
The dataset for this project contains 372450 images of alphabets of 28Ã—2, all present in the form of a CSV file:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format
